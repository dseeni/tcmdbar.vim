This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1779

This script is only for users of Total Commander and Win32 (maybe Win16).

After proper installation:
Start Total Commander, select one or more files, then click the GVim button.
GVim will create an argument list from the selected files so you can edit them.
Sounds trivial, but it is not.

Works with Ctrl-B (show flattened file list).


Customization for _vimrc (optional)

Open files in windows, tab pages or in diff mode:
    :let Tcmdbar_OpenIn = "Windows"
    :let Tcmdbar_OpenIn = "Tabs"        " ignored in Vim6
    :let Tcmdbar_OpenIn = "Diff Mode"

Values may be abbreviated to "win", "tab" and "diff".


You will get an error if you want to open too many files.  In this case
Vim will only open windows/tabs for as many files as possible.

If the first argument is always the file list, the plugin actually isn't needed!
You can define the button this way:
    Command: <path>\gvim.exe "+n `=readfile(argv(0))`"
    Parameters: %L
In the help:
    :h `=
    :h next_f
